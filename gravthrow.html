<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    A competitive online multiplayer game
    where players must pass and shoot a ball
    to score goals
    in a gravity-bending spatial arena.
    Inspired by games such as <i>Manifold Garden</i>
    and <i>Rocket League</i>.

<p>
    This was developed as part of an undergraduate dissertation
    looking into accessibility for competitive online multiplayer games.
