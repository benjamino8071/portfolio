    This project began as a prototype made in 2 days for a game jam. After receiving strong feedback
    about its potential I chose to continue development. As this was during my time working on Reptyle,
    I had to work on the project over weekends.

<h2>Key Achievements</h2>

<h3>Responsive UI</h3>

    This involved refactoring the system to check for screen resolution changes.
