<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    An online multiplayer VR game
    where players capture and ride dinosaurs over a dynamic landscape.
    Inspired by 'playground-style' games like <i>Gorilla Tag</i> and <i>Animal Company</i>.

<h2>Key Contributions</h2>

<h3>Online Connectivity</h3>

<p>
    Used Unity Gaming Services to establish online connections
    and voice chat communication between players.
</p>

<p>
    Through remote procedure calls we used a custom command system to
    share object data over a network. This gave us more control over physics and state handling.
</p>

<h3>UI</h3>

<p>
    Created a modular system for 'touch' and 'spatial' UI.

</p>

<p>
    Used experience gained from GravThrow about the importance of building atomic objects
    and layout components to easily modify panels.

<h3>Items</h3>

<p>
    Developed the system for creating, destroying, and handling in-game items.
</p>

<p>
    Two items in the game, the bow and arrow, were fundamental to interacting with the world.
    Players could fire 'capture' arrows at dinosaurs to transform them into an egg.
</p>

<h3>Dino Riding</h3>

<p>
    Contributed to iterative development of the riding mechanic.
</p>

<p>
    In an attempt to simulate riding on 'dinoback', we initially decided to use the relative distance of the
    player's hands from their avatar to determine the speed and rotation of the dinosaur.
</p>

<p>
    While working on this mechanic we kept running into compromises between comfort and control;
    we realised that player rotation had to (for the most part) be independent of dinosaur rotation to avoid a nauseating parallax effect.
    This, however, meant choosing which z-axis to use when measuring the player's arm extensions: do we use the player's, or the dinosaur's?
</p>

<p>
    To add, we also noticed the player had to make a constant trade-off between speed and rotation.
</p>

<p>
    We eventually found a suitable solution, with the thumbstick used for speed and the arm extension for rotation.
</p>

<p>
    Overall this was a challenging task for the team,
    requiring clear communication with the designers and in-game tools to modify parameters at runtime.
